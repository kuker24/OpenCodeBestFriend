# Ask Matt

Follow the thin router in `~/.config/opencode/AGENTS.md`. If routing is non-obvious, Read `~/.config/opencode/bestfriend/rules/00-routing.md`. Route only to skills installed here. Do not load every specialist. One primary specialist, plus at most one verification specialist when a risk or measured-performance trigger is on.

## Installed

**Plan:** `ask-matt` `grill-with-docs` `grilling` `to-spec` `to-tickets` `tdd` · architecture DAG = OpenCode plan agent

**Write:** this session. Matt ticket loop only: `/matt-implement`. Test-first: `tdd`.

**Review:** in-session (default). `matt-code-review` if they asked two-axis Standards + Spec. `/interrogate` for adversarial multi-review (manual).

**Design:** `found-this-design` `impeccable` `visual-studio` `scroll-world` `emil-design-eng`

**Documents:** `smartdoc` (per-job). `smartbook-ingest` only to compile/update reusable knowledge.

**Engineering (auto when the description matches):** `diagnosing-bugs` `domain-modeling` `codebase-design` `writing-for-agents` `research` `prototype`

**Engineering (manual / slash only):** `/architect` `/arena` `/blast-radius` `/why` `/figure-it-out` `/decision-log` `/improve-codebase-architecture` `/create-verification-skill` `/maintain-verification-skill` `/technical-writing` `/unslop` `/reflect` `/wizard` `/wait-what`

**Browser / GitHub / risk:** `browser-act` `chrome-devtools-axi` `gh-axi` `full-audit-keamanan` `full-performance-audit` `adhd`

**Not installed — say so, then use the nearest installed skill:** `/design` `/execute-plan` `/implement` `/review` `/code-review` `/imagine` `/docx` `/pdf` `/pptx` `/grill-me` `/handoff` `/triage` `/wayfinder` `/bro` `/poteto-mode` `/swarm` `/setup-matt-pocock-skills` `/pr-babysit` `/create-skill` `/create-workflow` `/build-with-ai` `game-asset-*`

## Route

1. Repo evidence is enough → do the work.
2. User typed a slash command → load it.
3. Architecture / PR-plan DAG → OpenCode plan agent, then implement in-session after approval.
4. Feature needs an interview, glossary, or ADR → `grill-with-docs`. Then `to-spec` → `to-tickets` only if they asked for tickets or the work is multi-session.
5. Ordinary implementation → write here. `tdd` when test-first. Do not start `/matt-implement` unless they are on a `/to-tickets` ticket.
6. UI world unknown → `found-this-design` then `impeccable`. World already chosen → `impeccable`.
7. Official library/docs fact → `research` (Context7). Why *this repo* chose an approach → `/why` (manual).
8. A missing Matt/Pstack name is the only named fit → say it is not installed. Use `grill-with-docs`, in-session write, in-session review, `adhd`, or `impeccable`.

## Phase boundaries

Continue if this session still holds the why. Start a new session if the window is disposable. Task tool for a scoped AFK task. OpenCode native compaction last.
